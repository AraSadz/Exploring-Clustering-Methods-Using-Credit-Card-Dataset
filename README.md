# Exploring Clustering Methods: Using Credit Card Dataset
In this notebook we will explore different approaches for clustering using the credit card dataset available on kaggle. After initially exploring the dataset to get familiar with the data, we will carry out data cleaning to prepare the data for the clustering task. Handling skewness, deleting outliers, handling null values and duplicate values are amongst the actions that we will perform to clean our data. Afterwards, we consider the clustering problem. K Mean, Agglomerative Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and Mean Shift clustering are applied on our data. Finally, we have drawn some conclusion and results.
